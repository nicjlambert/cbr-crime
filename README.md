## Overview
This code uses the pandas and folium libraries in Python to create a map of Canberra, Australia with markers for neighborhoods in the city. The code uses latitude and longitude coordinates to geocode the addresses of each neighborhood and then uses the Foursquare API to find nearby venues for each neighborhood. The code then creates a map of the neighborhoods and markers for each neighborhood with a pop-up showing the top venues in each neighborhood.

## Dependencies
The code requires the following libraries:

* pandas
* geocoder
* folium

## Usage
To use the code, you will need to provide your own Foursquare API credentials by setting the `FSQ_CLIENT_ID` and `FSQ_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables. You will also need to provide the path to the file containing the neighborhood data in the cbr_geo dataframe.

The code can then be run using the following steps:

Read the data from the file and store it in a dataframe using the pandas read_csv() function.
Use the geocoder library to geocode the addresses of each neighborhood and add the latitude and longitude coordinates to the dataframe.
Use the folium library to create a map of Canberra with markers for each neighborhood, showing the top venues in each neighborhood when clicked.

## Output
The code will generate an HTML file containing the map of Canberra with markers for each neighborhood. This file can be opened in a web browser to view the map.
